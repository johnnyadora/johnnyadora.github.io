Hello, I'm JoAdora and this is my story:
Growing up by the Belgian seaside, I got into sports such as kitesurfing and skateboarding from a very young age, which gave me a passion for boards and their designs.

I started by painting on my first skateboard which I got when I was 11 years old.

Re-shaping it first, then re-painting it again and again. Eventually people's used boards started to find their way to me and that's how I got into recycling old skateboards into newly shaped, hand-painted, little works of art. Later I expanded my canvas to walls and entire rooms, the bigger the better. 

I fell in love with woodworking when I started converting my car into a tiny campervan using only a jigsaw and a drill. Like many good things, it took time and a lot of effort. After two long years I took her to Portugal on her maiden voyage for a surftrip, this made it all worth while. On top of my tiny house on wheels, I had earned a new set of skills, which I'm still perfecting to this day.

In brief, that's me, I paint and I make things.
