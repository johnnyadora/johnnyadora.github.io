For this mural I was asked to fill a 10x2.5m wall with a pool-themed painting. The biggest wall I decorated so far… lucky for me, it was in my favourite country: Portugal! I began around November of 2019 but was unable to finish because of the humid weather. I returned the next year in September to finish it.

Since the wall was so big, I bought a laser to help me with the perspective. I had to be creative to level it at the desired height, using only what I had at hand. (paint pots, power banks, cookies,…)

The beginning of a nebula. I used glow in the dark paint for the stars.

Can you believe I had a sore neck and back after this?

And this is part II, in the summer of 2020: Picking up where I left off.

Painting until late at night in my brother’s company. We discovered the pool had night-lighting and had fun taking some photos. 
Certain nights were so clear that we were able to observe Saturn (and its rings!) and Jupiter (and its moons!) through a nature telescope.

The perspective is starting to look nice. There’s some  water in the pool.

And we have the diver, ready to make the leap. (But waiting for me to give her hair.)

And there we go, much better.

I tried my best to really make the painting blend together with the house, playing around with the perspective and colour.
