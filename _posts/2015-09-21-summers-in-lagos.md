I started kitesurfing at the age of 14 and immediately fell in love with the sport. 
It was a 3-minute walk to the beach so the surfclub was pretty much my second home. 
Later on I started teaching, because I needed the money for more kites!
In my student years I applied for a teaching job in Lagos and had such a great time that I returned 3 years in a row! 

The picture bellow was taken by a [travelling photographer](https://www.facebook.com/surfsouvenir).

My private rooftop terrace, above the guesthouse.
It's where I lived the whole summer, saw so many shooting stars at night!

The boss was a huge Jim Phillips fan and when he heard I could paint, he asked me if I could try to paint his favourite piece. Being a big Santa Cruz fan myself, I couldn't refuse!
